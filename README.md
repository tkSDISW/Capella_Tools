# Capella Tools

Capella Tools is a collection of utilities designed to enhance the capabilities of Capella users in performing requirement development, report generation, and verification tasks directly from Capella models.

## Purpose
This repository provides tools that enable:
- Requirement development from Capella models
- Report generation based on model content
- Verification-related tasks using Capella models

## Audience
This toolkit is intended for the general Capella user community.

## Included Tools
- **Report Generators**: Generate structured reports from Capella models.
- **Digital System Engineering (SE) Fabric Generator**: Create digital SE fabric from systems engineering models.
- **Embedding-Based Model Search and Retrieval Tools**: Efficiently search and retrieve model components using embeddings.
- **Prompt Generation for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: Generate prompts from Capella models and attached files to support RAG workflows.

## Installation
To install the tools, use the following command:
```bash
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/tkSDISW/Capella_Tools
```

## Examples

The repository includes three example folders that demonstrate how to use Capella Tools:

- **Auto Example**  
- **Ventilator Example**  
- **Trail_Power**

Each folder contains:
- A Capella model that can be loaded into the Capella modeling environment.
- A `Notebook` folder with Jupyter notebooks showcasing Python code that utilizes Capella Tools for various tasks.

These examples provide practical insights into how the tools can be applied to real-world systems engineering scenarios.
