       "<h2>1. Purpose of the Diagram</h2>\n",
       "<p>The diagram titled <strong>'[LAB] Braking'</strong> represents the interactions and relationships associated with the braking mechanisms within a vehicular system. The purpose of this diagram is to highlight the various components, their interactions, and how they collectively contribute to the braking functionality in a car. It's an intricate model that involves logical functions, parts, component exchanges, and the relationships between these elements.</p>\n",
       "<h2>Related Nodes</h2>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>CAN BUS</li>\n",
       "<li>Relay Messages</li>\n",
       "<li>Brake Pedal</li>\n",
       "<li>Brake Force Sensor</li>\n",

       "<li>Wheel Speed Sensors</li>\n",
       "<li>Hydraulic Control Modulator</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<h2>2. Node Representation in the ARCADIA Method</h2>\n",
       "<p>In the ARCADIA (Architecture Analysis and Design Integrated Approach) method, nodes within a system model hold distinct roles representing either components, functions, or interfaces. Here's how the nodes in this diagram can be interpreted:</p>\n",
       "<h3>Interpretation of Nodes</h3>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li><strong>Logical Functions:</strong> Represent the operations or processes performed by the system, such as \"Relay Messages\", \"Apply Brake\", and \"Reduce Skid\".</li>\n",
       "<li><strong>Parts:</strong> Physical components involved in the system. Examples include the \"Brake Pedal\", \"Brake Force Sensor\", and \"Hydraulic Control Modulator\".</li>\n",
       "<li><strong>Component Exchanges:</strong> These demonstrate the interactions or exchanges of information between parts. They are critical to understanding the flow of data and signals, such as between \"CAN BUS\" and other components.</li>\n",
       "<li><strong>Interactions with the Environment:</strong> Nodes like \"Environment\" and \"Terrain/Roads\" reflect external influences on the system, affecting how the braking functions perform under different conditions.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<h3>Description of the Diagram</h3>\n",
       "<p>This diagram provides a comprehensive view of how the braking system in a vehicle operates. By utilizing logical functions and their allocation across various physical parts, it outlines the process flow - from the initiation of braking by the driver to the activation of different sensors and control units ensuring efficient braking force deployment. The inclusion of environmental elements like weather and terrain further adds realism by showcasing their impact on braking performance.</p>\n",

    "- Uses the generated structured input file (e.g., `capella_model.yaml`) to guide the conversation.\n",
    "- Supports ARCADIA terms such as **functions**, **components**, **activities**, and **exchanges**.\n",
    "- Incorporates Polarion terms like **workitem**, **requirement**, and **traceability** for seamless integration with requirements management workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "1. The structured input file provides context for the chat session.\n",
    "2. You can interactively query details about the model elements, relationships, and dependencies.\n",
    "3. Responses are tailored using ARCADIA and Polarion terminology.\n",
